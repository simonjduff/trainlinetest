        1) List three to five key concerns with this implementation that you would discuss with the junior developer. 

        Please leave the rest of this file as it is so we can discuss your concerns during the next stage of the interview process.
        
        *) Mode is [Flags] but checked with Equality (==). 
            The way this is coded suggests mutually exclusive states,
            but the [Flags] suggest Mode can be both states at once.
            This is confusing for a developer coming in and could be indicative of
            bad modelling or a future bug.
        *) An exception during read/write won't close the streams. The closing should be
            handled using the IDisposable interface implemented on File streams.
        *) You can write N columns, but only read 2 columns. This lacks consistency,
            genericness, and violates Open/Closed principle. If this is a generic CSV implementation
            it should be agnostic about the number of columns and return a collection. If it's
            specific for AddressProcessing, it should have Domain names rather than
            column1, column2. Strongly suggest keeping this generic and implementing
            the Domain side in a calling class.
        *) You can Open a Stream in Write or Read mode, but then call Write or Read
            in opposition of the Open mode. Ie another developer could call Open(Read)
            and then Write(), which would fail. Close the streams using IDisposable.
        *) Duplication between the two Read methods. Why does the non-Out Read method
            even exist? Is this a previous iteration of code that should've been cleaned up?
